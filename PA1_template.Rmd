## Loading and preprocessing the data

Let's start the analysis by loading the dataset that is provided with the question. The dataset is provided as a compressed comma-separated values file from [this location](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip). To start the analysis, we'll download the file, and uncompress it to the `dataset` folder if it doesn't already exist locally.

```{r downloadAndUncompressData, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

datasetFolder <- "dataset"
datasetFile <- paste(datasetFolder, "activity.csv", sep = "/")

if (!file.exists(datasetFolder)) {
    dir.create(datasetFolder);
}

# Download dataset if it doesn't exist
if (!file.exists(datasetFile)) {
    localZip <- "activity.zip"
    remoteZip <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
    download.file(remoteZip, destfile = localZip, method = "curl")
    unzip(localZip, exdir = datasetFolder)
    unlink(localZip);
}

# Load the data into memory
data <- read.csv(datasetFile, header = TRUE)
dataWithoutNA <- data[!is.na(data$steps),]

# Aggregate the number of steps per day
stepsPerDay <- dataWithoutNA %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(totalSteps = sum(steps))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Now that we have the data loaded, we can start answering the questions. First of all, let's look at the distribution of the number of steps, by plotting a histogram of the number of steps per day. In this chart let's also add a line indicating the mean of the total steps.

```{r echo=TRUE}
g <- ggplot(stepsPerDay, aes(x = totalSteps))
g <- g + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = "white", color = "black", size = 1)
g <- g + geom_vline(color = "red", aes(xintercept = mean(totalSteps)))
g
```

The chart shows the mean a little under 11000 steps, let's get the accurate value:

```{r echo=TRUE}
totalStepsMean <- mean(stepsPerDay$totalSteps)
totalStepsMedian <- median(stepsPerDay$totalSteps)
```

Based on the code above, we can see that the mean total steps per day is `r format(totalStepsMean, digits = 7)`, and its median is `r totalStepsMedian`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Now lets check the average daily pattern for the dataset, to try to understand the distribution of the number of steps taken based on the time of the day. To do that, let's summarize the data, this time grouping by the interval. We'll also convert the numeric *interval* column in the data frame into a character column which better represents the time of the day:

```{r echo=TRUE}
stepsPerInterval <- dataWithoutNA %>%
    group_by(interval) %>%
    summarise(avgSteps = mean(steps))
intervalHours <- stepsPerInterval$interval %/% 100
intervalMinutes <- stepsPerInterval$interval %% 100
stepsPerInterval$timeOfDay <- as.POSIXct("2015-01-01") +
    intervalHours * 60 * 60 +
    intervalMinutes * 60
rm(list = c("intervalHours", "intervalMinutes")) # Clean-up temporary variables
```

And now we can plot the number of steps per time of day to better analyze the daily activity pattern:

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(stepsPerInterval, aes(x = timeOfDay, y = avgSteps, group = 1)) +
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle("Average steps per time of day") +
    xlab("Time of day") +
    ylab("Average number of steps per 5-minute interval") +
    scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%H:%M"))
```

From this chart we can see that the most active period of the day for the subject from this dataset is early in the morning, between 8:15 and 9:00, followed by some spikes around noon (lunch time), in the middle of the afternoon (maybe a coffee break) and a little after 6:00 (dinner time).

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
